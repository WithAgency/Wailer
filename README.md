# Wailer

Wailer (WITH Mailer) is an utility that builds on top of Django's emailing
capabilities (and SMS through `django-sms`) in order to provide easy solutions
to common emailing problems.

- Inlining CSS of emails you send
- Have direct-access URLs for those emails
- Manage the localization (even from a server-side task)
