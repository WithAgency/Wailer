def monkey_patch_sms_into_unit_tests():

    Django's test runner will take care to change some essential settings to
    make testing easier, including having a memory-only email backend. That's
    definitely a behavior we also want to have for SMS sending as well.

    Good news and bad news: there are no official way to hook on test runner
    initialization, but you can always monkey patch and do the same thing for
    SMSes as what is done for emails.

    So basically this is fairly dirty code that will need to be maintained from
    one version of Django to the other one. However, since it's going to break
    the tests if Django breaks this internal interface, we'll notice it
    quickly I guess.
